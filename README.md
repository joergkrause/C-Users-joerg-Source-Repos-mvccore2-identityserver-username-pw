# ASP.NET Core IdentityServer4 with Custom User Base

## Based on

This project was pulled from this one:

https://damienbod.com/2017/04/14/asp-net-core-identityserver4-resource-owner-password-flow-with-custom-userrepository/

I ported it to Core 2 and simplified the UI partially. Dependency to SQlite removed and replaced by (localdb). Several renamings to clarify usage scenarios. UI improvements.
